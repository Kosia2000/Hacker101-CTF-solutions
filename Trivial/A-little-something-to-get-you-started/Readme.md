# A little something to get you started

The first page after the task is launched:

I decided to take a look at the source code of the site, where I found the `background.png` file:

</p>

I came to the conclusion that it is worth checking if I have access to this file, so I used the url https://bc8e7459acc3646847a2ac6f07a415f5.ctf.hacker101.com/background.png. This way I received the flag I was looking for.
